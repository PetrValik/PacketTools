# Packet-tools

It was a school project. The goal was to create a program for analyzing and filtering packets based on defined rules.

A basic program skeleton was provided and used for debugging and integration. I worked on `capture.c`, `capture.h`, and `nft.c`.

No AI tools were used during the development of this project.

More information about the project and assignment can be found in the file `assignment.ad`.
